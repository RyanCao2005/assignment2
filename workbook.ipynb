        "\n",
        "We're studying the problem of predicting which streamer a user will watch next based on their viewing history. This is a sequential prediction task we want to model how users move between different streamers over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "The key insight is that viewing behavior has temporal patterns. If someone just watched streamer A, they might be more likely to watch streamer B next. A 5th-order Markov model captures these patterns by looking at the last 5 streamers a user watched to predict the next one.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Input**: The last k streamers a user watched: `[streamer_t-k, ..., streamer_t-1]`  \n",
        "**Output**: A probability distribution over all possible streamers for what they'll watch next\n",
        "\n",
        "This task is interesting to us because:\n",
        "- Users often watch related streamers in sequence (gaming streamers, day in the life, etc.), users often click around streams rather than staying in a single one usually.\n",
        "- Unlike traditional recommendation, streamers are only available when they're live, which adds complexity\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1.2 Evaluation Metrics\n",
        "\n",
        "We'll use several metrics to evaluate how well the model performs. Since our Markov model outputs a probability distribution over all streamers, we can rank them and evaluate the ranking quality:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Top-K Accuracy**: This measures whether the true next streamer appears in the top K predictions. We'll report Top-1, Top-5, and Top-10 accuracy. Top-K makes sense for recommendation systems since users typically see a list of suggestions, not just one prediction.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)**: This is particularly well-suited for our Markov chain approach. Since we output probability distributions and rank all streamers, MRR tells us how highly ranked the true next streamer is. Even if the model doesn't get the exact #1 prediction right, it's useful to know if the true answer is in the top 5 or top 10. MRR is calculated as the average of 1/rank for each test case, where rank is the position of the true streamer in our ranked list. Higher MRR is better (closer to 1.0 means the true answer is usually near the top).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Perplexity**: This measures how \"surprised\" the model is by the test data. Lower perplexity means the model is more confident and accurate in its probability predictions. It's calculated as `exp(-mean(log_likelihood))`. This is especially useful for Markov models since it directly evaluates the quality of the probability distributions we're learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Coverage**: This measures what percentage of unique streamers appear in the top-K predictions. We want to make sure the model isn't just predicting the same popular streamers over and over - diversity matters for a good recommendation system.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Note on probabilistic models**: Both Markov chains and logistic regression are probabilistic models that output conditional probabilities. Markov chains directly estimate `P(next_streamer | previous_k_streamers)` by counting transitions in the training data, while logistic regression learns `P(class | features)` through optimization. Both use Bayes' theorem implicitly - Markov chains model the joint distribution and derive conditionals, while logistic regression directly models the conditional distribution. The key difference is that Markov chains are generative (model sequences) while logistic regression is discriminative (classify given features), but both give us probability distributions we can rank and evaluate with MRR.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1.3 Baseline Models\n",
        "\n",
        "Based on the baselines used in the original LiveRec paper and common recommendation practices, we'll compare our 5th-order Markov model against:\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. POP (Popularity Baseline)**: Always predicts the most popular streamer globally. This is the simplest possible baseline - if we can't beat this, our model isn't useful. This matches the `POP` baseline from the liverec repository.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1.4 Model Validity Assessment\n",
        "\n",
        "To make sure our results are valid, we'll:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Use temporal splitting**: Train on earlier time periods and test on later ones. This prevents data leakage and mimics how the model would actually be deployed - we can't use future information to predict the past.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Hold out a test set**: We'll use an 80/10/10 split for train/validation/test. The validation set is for tuning hyperparameters (like smoothing parameters), and the test set is only used for final evaluation.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Prevent data leakage**: Make sure sequences are created in temporal order, and that any feature extraction (like building vocabularies) only uses training data.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Compare systematically**: We'll run all baselines and our model on the same test set and report all metrics consistently. We'll also do some qualitative analysis - look at cases where the model fails and see if there are patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Test different configurations**: We'll compare 1st, 3rd, and 5th order Markov models to see if the extra complexity is worth it. We'll also test different smoothing parameters to see how sensitive the model is.\n"

        "\n",
        "We formulate next streamer prediction as a **sequence modeling problem** using Markov chains. Here's how we framed it as a machine learning task:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Input**: A sequence of the last k streamers a user watched, represented as a tuple: `(streamer_t-k, streamer_t-k+1, ..., streamer_t-1)`\n",
        "\n",
        "**Output**: A probability distribution over all possible streamers: `P(streamer_t | streamer_t-k, ..., streamer_t-1)`\n",
        "\n",
        "**What we're optimizing**: We're maximizing the likelihood of observed sequences in the training data. For a kth-order Markov model, we estimate transition probabilities by counting how often each k+1-length sequence appears:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "P(streamer_t | streamer_t-k, ..., streamer_t-1) = \n",

        "\n",
        "**Why Markov models are appropriate**: \n",
        "- Sequential recommendation naturally fits the Markov assumption: the next streamer depends on recent viewing history\n",
        "- Markov chains are interpretable - we can see which streamer transitions are most likely\n",
        "- They're efficient to train (just counting) and fast to query (lookup in a dictionary)\n",
        "- They handle the dynamic availability constraint naturally - we can filter predictions to only currently live streamers\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key challenge**: Data sparsity. Most k+1-length sequences never appear in training data. We address this with:\n",
        "- **Smoothing**: Add-k smoothing or backoff to lower-order models\n",
        "- **Backoff**: If a 5th-order sequence isn't seen, fall back to 4th-order, then 3rd, etc.\n",
        "- **Handling cold-start**: For sequences we've never seen, use popularity or user-specific baselines\n"

        "To demonstrate why Markov chains are a better choice for sequential prediction, we implement several simple baselines that ignore sequence information. These baselines help us understand:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **How much does sequence information help?** If Markov chains don't outperform simple popularity, then sequences aren't that important for this task.\n",
        "2. **What's the value of higher-order patterns?** Comparing 1st-order vs. 5th-order Markov shows whether longer sequences matter.\n",
        "3. **Is personalization important?** User popularity baseline shows if individual preferences matter beyond sequences.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Baselines we implement**:\n",
        "- **POP (Global Popularity)**: Always predicts the most popular streamer globally. This is the simplest possible baseline - if we can't beat this, our model isn't useful.\n",
        "- **REP (User Popularity/Repeat)**: Predicts based on each user's personal viewing history - ranks streamers by how often the user has watched them. This captures personal preferences and repeat consumption patterns.\n",
        "- **1st-Order Markov**: Predicts based only on the last streamer watched. This helps us see if higher-order dependencies (5th order) actually improve performance.\n",

        "**Idea 2: Personalized Sequence Filtering**\n",

        "Weight positions in the sequence based on user preferences - if the user has watched a streamer in the sequence many times, give that position more weight:\n",

        "Different users might benefit from different Markov orders. Users with diverse viewing history might need higher-order patterns, while users with focused interests might do better with lower-order:\n",

        "**Idea 5: Personalized Smoothing**\n",
        "Users with more viewing history should have less smoothing (more trust in observed transitions), while new users need more smoothing:\n",

        "\n",
        "As discussed in the course notes on temporal recommendation systems (see [temporal.pdf](file:///c%3A/Users/Ryan_pc/CSE158R/temporal.pdf)), there are several approaches to sequential recommendation. We considered the following:\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. kth-Order Markov Chains** (our chosen approach)\n",
        "- **Advantages**: \n",
        "  - Simple and interpretable - transition probabilities are just counts, following the standard Markov chain formulation\n",
        "  - Fast training (O(n) where n is number of interactions) and prediction (O(1) lookup)\n",
        "  - Naturally handles sequences and temporal patterns, as noted in the course material\n",
        "  - Easy to implement from scratch - no complex optimization needed\n",
        "  - As the course notes mention, Markov chains are a \"traditional\" model that work well when sequence patterns are the main signal\n",
        "- **Disadvantages**:\n",
        "  - Data sparsity: higher-order models need exponentially more data (as discussed in temporal.pdf)\n",
        "  - Assumes only last k items matter (Markov property) - can't capture very long-term dependencies\n",
        "  - Doesn't capture long-term user preferences or item features (no personalization beyond sequence)\n",
        "  - Memory grows with vocabulary size^k (though in practice we only store seen sequences)\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Factorized Personalized Markov Chains (FPMC)**\n",
        "- **Advantages**: Combines Matrix Factorization (MF) with Markov chains, capturing both user preferences and sequential patterns. As noted in the course notes, FPMC models third-order relationships between user u, previous item i, and next item j by combining pairwise relationships: `P(j | u, i) ∝ ⟨M_u, N_j⟩ + ⟨P_i, Q_j⟩` where the first term captures user-item compatibility and the second captures item-item transitions.\n",
        "- **Disadvantages**: Much more complex, requires optimization (gradient descent), harder to interpret, needs learned embeddings\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Translation-based Models (TransRec)**\n",
        "- **Advantages**: Models transitions as translations in embedding space: `prev_item + user_translation ≈ next_item`. As discussed in the course notes, this captures both personalization and sequences in a unified way.\n",
        "- **Disadvantages**: Requires learned embeddings and optimization, more complex than simple Markov chains\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Matrix Factorization (MF)**\n",
        "- **Advantages**: Captures latent user/item preferences, handles sparsity well\n",
        "- **Disadvantages**: Doesn't model sequences - treats interactions as independent, requires learned embeddings, more complex to implement\n",
        "\n",
        "**5. Deep Learning (RNN/LSTM/Transformer)**\n",
        "- **Advantages**: As the course notes mention, these can capture longer-term dynamics compared to Markov chains. They can potentially model complex patterns like users revisiting items across sessions or next items being relevant to combinations of recent items.\n",
        "- **Disadvantages**: Requires large datasets, long training time, black-box (harder to interpret), often simpler approaches are favorable when we have limited data (as noted in temporal.pdf)\n",
        "\n",
        "**6. Collaborative Filtering (Jaccard Similarity)**\n",
        "- **Advantages**: Simple, captures user similarity patterns\n",
        "- **Disadvantages**: Doesn't model sequences, only uses co-occurrence\n",
        "\n",
        "**Our choice**: We use a 5th-order Markov model because:\n",
        "1. It's appropriate for the task (sequential prediction) and aligns with the course material's emphasis on sequence-based approaches\n",
        "2. It's interpretable - we can explain why predictions are made by showing transition probabilities\n",
        "3. It's efficient enough to run on the full dataset without requiring GPU or complex optimization\n",
        "4. It allows us to compare different orders (1st, 3rd, 5th) to understand the trade-off between complexity and performance\n",
        "5. We can implement it from scratch and understand every detail, which is valuable for learning\n",
        "\n",
        "**Trade-offs we're making**:\n",
        "- **Order selection**: 5th order balances capturing patterns vs. data sparsity. Higher orders (7th, 10th) would be too sparse given our dataset size; lower orders (1st, 2nd) miss important multi-step patterns. We'll empirically validate this by comparing orders.\n",
        "- **Smoothing strategy**: We use add-k smoothing to handle unseen sequences. More sophisticated backoff (Kneser-Ney smoothing) could help but adds complexity. Simple backoff to lower-order models is a good compromise.\n",
        "- **Memory vs. accuracy**: We store all k+1-length sequences that appear in training. For very large vocabularies, we might need pruning or hashing, but for our dataset this is manageable.\n",
        "- **Personalization**: Unlike FPMC or TransRec, we don't explicitly model user preferences - we rely purely on sequence patterns. This is simpler but may miss user-specific preferences that persist across sessions.\n"

        "### 3.3 Implementation Details and Architectural Choices\n",
        "\n",
        "**Sequence Extraction**: Following the standard approach for Markov chain training, we extract sequences by grouping interactions by user and sorting by `start` time to preserve temporal order. For a 5th-order model, each sequence is a tuple of 5 consecutive streamers, with the 6th as the target. This creates training examples of the form `(sequence, next_streamer)` where we learn `P(next_streamer | sequence)`.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Temporal Splitting**: As emphasized in the course notes on temporal data mining, we split data by time (80/10/10) rather than randomly to prevent data leakage. This mimics real deployment where we predict future behavior using only past data. This is critical for sequential models - using future information would give unrealistically good performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Data Structures** (following standard Markov chain implementation):\n",
        "- `transition_counts`: Dictionary mapping k-sequences to Counters of next streamers. This is the core of the model - we count how often each transition occurs, following the maximum likelihood estimation approach for Markov chains.\n",
        "- `vocab`: Set of all streamers seen in training. Used for smoothing calculations (vocabulary size affects smoothing denominator).\n",
        "- `global_popularity`: Counter of streamer frequencies. Used for cold-start when sequences are completely unseen (fallback to popularity baseline).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Smoothing Strategy**: We use **add-k smoothing** (also called Laplace smoothing), which is standard for handling unseen events in probabilistic models:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "P(s | sequence) = (count(sequence, s) + k) / (count(sequence) + k * |vocab|)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "This prevents zero probabilities and gives small probability mass to unseen transitions. We set `k=0.1` as a default (can be tuned on validation set). This is similar to how n-gram language models handle unseen word sequences.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Backoff Strategy**: When a kth-order sequence is unseen, we fall back to (k-1)th order, then (k-2)th, etc. This is a simple but effective way to handle sparsity, similar to backoff in n-gram models. For example, if `(A, B, C, D, E)` is unseen, we try `(B, C, D, E)`, then `(C, D, E)`, etc. This allows us to use higher-order patterns when available, but gracefully degrade to lower-order patterns when data is sparse.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Cold-Start Handling**: For completely new sequences (even with backoff), we use global popularity. This ensures we always have a prediction, even if it's just \"predict the most popular streamer.\" This is a common fallback strategy in recommendation systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Memory Efficiency**: We only store sequences that appear in training data. For a 5th-order model with 162k streamers, the theoretical maximum is 162k^5 sequences, but in practice we only see a tiny fraction of these (most sequences never occur). The actual memory usage is O(unique_sequences_in_training), which is much more manageable.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Prediction Efficiency**: Prediction is O(1) lookup in the transition_counts dictionary, plus O(vocab_size) for probability normalization. With backoff, worst-case is O(order * vocab_size), which is still very fast. This efficiency is one advantage of Markov chains over learned embedding models that require matrix multiplications.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Design Decisions**:\n",
        "1. **Order=5**: Chosen to balance pattern capture vs. sparsity. As the course notes mention, higher-order models need exponentially more data. We'll compare with 1st and 3rd order to validate this choice empirically.\n",
        "2. **Smoothing=0.1**: Small pseudocount to handle unseen transitions without over-smoothing common ones. Can be tuned on validation set.\n",
        "3. **Backoff enabled**: Helps with sparsity, especially for higher-order models. This is a standard technique in sequence modeling.\n",
        "4. **Available streamers filtering**: In real deployment (as discussed in the LiveRec paper), we'd filter predictions to only currently live streamers. For now, we predict over all streamers for simplicity, but the infrastructure supports this filtering.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Comparison to Course Material**: Our implementation follows the standard Markov chain approach discussed in the temporal recommendation notes. Unlike FPMC (which combines MF with Markov chains) or TransRec (which uses learned embeddings), we use a pure Markov chain that relies solely on transition counts. This is simpler but may miss user-specific preferences that persist across different sequences.\n"
